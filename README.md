# EXCEL-for-Deep-Learning
Personally, I find it is very useful to use EXCEL to replicate the maths behind papers.  Sometimes, complex maths notations can be expressed in simple EXCEL functions.  

Note: For gradient decent, please ensure to have 'Solver' as add-on and choose "GRG Nonlinear" as solving method.
